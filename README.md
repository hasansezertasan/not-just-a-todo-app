## About

> Birthday of the idea: 16 February 2023 Thursday - 19:00 (It's all clear now...)

It's been a long time since I planned to make this app. I also wanted to try something different. Likewise, I haven't been developing an application with Flask for a while and I wanted to refresh my Flask knowledge.

I decided to develop an admin-interface-driven application with Flask, Flask Login and Flask Admin, Flask SQLAlchemy, Flask WTF and Bootstrap Flask. What I mean by admin-interface-driven is this: I haven't written a route with Flask, all pages delivered as Flask Admin views.

In summary, it's an attempt to use Flask Admin as a user interface instead of just using it as an administrative interface or admin only interface.

> Before I forget, I didn't write a single line of JavaScript, thanks to HTMX...
