## About

> Birthday of the idea: 16 February 2023 Thursday - 19:00 (It's all clear now...)

The application is built using Flask Admin and Flask Login and it's a Flask Admin driven application. All pages delivered using Flask Admin views.

## TODO

I can think of some features that I want to implement:

- Daily Routine (automatically instantiated every day)
- Instant Tasks (tasks that are not in a sequence)
